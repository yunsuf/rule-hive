- **Technique Libraries** - CSV databases of proven methods
- **Context Integration** - Optional document input for domain relevance
- **Structured Output** - Comprehensive reports with insights and actions
- **Energy Monitoring** - Adaptive pacing based on engagement

## Usage

### Basic Invocation

```bash
workflow brainstorming
workflow design-thinking
workflow innovation-strategy
workflow problem-solving
workflow storytelling
```

### With Context

```bash
workflow [workflow-name] --data /path/to/context.md
```

### Via Agent

```bash
agent cis/brainstorming-coach
> *brainstorm
```

## Configuration

Edit `/bmad/cis/config.yaml`:

| Setting                | Purpose                 | Default            |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| output_folder          | Result storage location | ./creative-outputs |
| user_name              | Session participant     | User               |
| communication_language | Facilitation language   | english            |

## Workflow Structure

Each workflow contains:

```
workflow-name/
├── workflow.yaml      # Configuration
├── instructions.md    # Facilitation guide
├── techniques.csv     # Method library
└── README.md         # Documentation
```

## Best Practices

1. **Prepare context** - Provide background documents for better results
2. **Set clear objectives** - Define goals before starting
3. **Trust the process** - Let facilitation guide discovery
4. **Capture everything** - Document insights as they emerge
5. **Take breaks** - Pause when energy drops

## Integration

CIS workflows integrate with:

- **BMM** - Project brainstorming and ideation
- **BMB** - Creative module design
- **Custom Modules** - Shared creative resource
